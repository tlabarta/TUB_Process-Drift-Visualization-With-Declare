# Input files go here

We put input logs here.

They are in two formats:
xes (compressed with extension .xes.gz)
csv (.csv)

> both of them should have timestamp_sorted at the end of the file name to be properly read

One can use the code in
<https://github.com/yesanton/Event-Log-Preprocessing-Tools>
in order to sort csv-coded event log with a timestamp.
